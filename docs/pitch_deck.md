# 🚧 GrabInfra Land Suitability Screening Platform

## Slide 1: The Problem
**Construction firms waste time and money scouting land without proper early-stage data.**

🔍 Layers Included:
- Soil type & surface stability (Sentinel-1/2)
- Slope & elevation (SRTM/ALOS)
- Flood risk (JRC, ALOS)
- Zoning compatibility (OSM, masterplans)
- Infrastructure proximity (roads/utilities)
- Environmental constraints (WDPA, forest cover)

🧠 Composite score gives instant Go/No-Go signal.
